- Unauthorized access to microphone/camera
- Data leakage through browser APIs
- Exposure of user recordings or sessions
- Fingerprinting or tracking issues

**Audio Security**
- Audio-based attacks or exploits
- Unauthorized audio recording or transmission
- Volume/frequency attacks that could damage hearing
- Audio data injection or manipulation

**Browser Security**
- Bypassing same-origin policy
- Exploiting Web Audio API vulnerabilities
- Local storage data exposure
- Service worker security issues

**Dependencies & Supply Chain**
- Vulnerabilities in p5.js, Tone.js, or other dependencies

## 🛠️ Our Security Practices

### Development Security
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular automated scanning of all dependencies
- **Code Analysis**: Static analysis tools integrated into CI/CD
- **Security Reviews**: Manual security review for sensitive code changes
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all user inputs and parameters

### Browser Security
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers where applicable
- **Secure Defaults**: Audio permissions requested explicitly

### Data Protection
- **Minimal Data Collection**: We collect no personal data by default
- **Local Processing**: All audio processing happens locally
- **No Server Storage**: No user data stored on our servers
- **Clear Permissions**: Explicit requests for microphone access

### Third-Party Security
- **CDN Integrity**: Subresource integrity checks for all CDN resources
- **Dependency Updates**: Regular updates of all dependencies
- **Vendor Assessment**: Security review of all third-party libraries
