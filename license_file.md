## Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by and pays tribute to Laurie Spiegel's original 
Music Mouse software from 1986. While this implementation is an independent 
recreation, we acknowledge Laurie Spiegel's pioneering contributions to 
computer music and algorithmic composition.

The original Music Mouse concept and design principles are credited to 
Laurie Spiegel. This modern web implementation serves as both homage and 
educational tool to introduce her innovative ideas to new generations of 
musicians and programmers.
