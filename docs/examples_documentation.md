## Musical Tutorials

### Tutorial 1: Understanding Scales

#### Exercise: Scale Comparison
1. **Start with Major Scale**
   - Press **2** for Major scale
   - Press **Q** for Chord treatment
   - Move mouse horizontally - notice the "happy" sound

2. **Switch to Minor Scale**
   - Press **3** for Natural Minor
   - Move in same pattern - notice the "sadder" sound

3. **Try Pentatonic**
   - Press **5** for Pentatonic
   - This scale "always sounds good" - great for beginners

4. **Experiment with Continuous**
   - Press **0** for Continuous scale
   - This gives you smooth frequency sweeps - great for sound effects

### Tutorial 2: Rhythmic Treatments

#### Exercise: Treatment Exploration
1. **Chord Treatment (Q)**
   ```
   - All lines play together
   - Great for: Harmonic exploration, full chords
   - Try: Slow movements for sustained chords
   ```

2. **Arpeggio Treatment (W)**
   ```
   - Lines play in sequence
   - Great for: Melodic patterns, classical feel
   - Try: Quick movements for fast arpeggios
   ```

3. **Line Treatment (E)**
   ```
   - Independent voice movement
   - Great for: Counterpoint, Bach-like textures
   - Try: Add more lines for complex polyphony
   ```

4. **Improvise Treatment (R)**
   ```
   - Random patterns
   - Great for: Experimental music, inspiration
   - Try: Long movements for evolving textures
   ```

5. **Phase Treatment (T)**
   ```
   - Minimalist phasing (Steve Reich style)
   - Great for: Ambient, meditative music
   - Try: Small movements for subtle shifts
   ```

### Tutorial 3: Line Management

#### Exercise: Building Complexity
1. **Start Simple**
   - Begin with default settings (3 vertical, 1 horizontal)
   - Get comfortable with basic movement

2. **Add Vertical Lines**
   - Press **â†‘** to add vertical lines (up to 8)
   - Each line represents a voice in the harmony

3. **Add Horizontal Lines**
   - Press **â†’** to add horizontal lines
   - These create additional melodic layers

4. **Balance Complexity**
   - More lines = richer harmony but harder to control
   - Find your sweet spot (typically 4-6 total lines)

## Creative Techniques

### Technique 1: Ambient Soundscapes

**Goal**: Create evolving ambient textures

```
Setup:
- Scale: Whole Tone (9) or Japanese (8)
- Treatment: Phase (T)
- Lines: 4-6 vertical, 2-3 horizontal
- Waveforms: Mix of Sine (Z) and Triangle (X)

Process:
1. Start in center of screen
2. Make very slow, circular movements
3. Occasionally switch to different waveforms
4. Record movements (M) to create loops
```

### Technique 2: Rhythmic Patterns

**Goal**: Create complex rhythmic sequences

```
Setup:
- Scale: Pentatonic (5) or Blues (6)
- Treatment: Arpeggio (W)
- Lines: 6-8 vertical lines
- Waveforms: Square (V) for percussive effect

Process:
1. Make quick, repeating movements
2. Try zigzag patterns
3. Use Contrary Motion spacing (G) for rhythm variation
4. Layer by recording and playing over (M, P)
```

### Technique 3: Melodic Composition

**Goal**: Create memorable melodies

```
Setup:
- Scale: Major (2) or Minor (3)
- Treatment: Line (E)
- Lines: 2-3 vertical, 1-2 horizontal
- Waveforms: Sine (Z) or Triangle (X) for clarity

Process:
1. Move smoothly and deliberately
2. Think in musical phrases (4-8 second movements)
3. Use transposition (A/S) to modulate
4. Record phrases and build compositions
```

### Technique 4: Experimental Textures

**Goal**: Explore unconventional sounds

```
Setup:
- Scale: Continuous (0) or Chromatic (1)
- Treatment: Improvise (R)
- Lines: Maximum (8 vertical, 8 horizontal)
- Waveforms: Sawtooth (C) for richness

Process:
1. Rapid, chaotic movements
2. Sudden direction changes
3. Explore extreme positions
4. Use individual waveform control per line
```

## Educational Applications

### Teaching Musical Intervals

**Objective**: Help students understand musical relationships

1. **Setup for Intervals**
   - Major scale (2)
   - Chord treatment (Q)
   - 2 vertical lines only

2. **Demonstrate Intervals**
   - Start at left edge (root note)
   - Move right gradually
   - Each position represents a different interval
   - Students can hear how intervals sound

3. **Interactive Exercise**
   - Call out interval names
   - Students find the correct position
   - Verify by listening to the harmony

### Understanding Frequency

**Objective**: Teach the physics of sound

1. **Use Continuous Scale (0)**
   - This maps directly to Hz (frequency)
   - Show frequency numbers when playing

2. **Demonstrate Concepts**
   - Higher position = higher frequency
   - Octaves: double the frequency
   - Musical ratios (3:2 for fifth, 4:3 for fourth)

3. **Visual Learning**
   - Frequency numbers appear during play
   - Students can see the math behind music

### Composition Basics

**Objective**: Introduce composition concepts

1. **Phrase Structure**
   - Record 4-beat phrases
   - Show how phrases combine
   - Demonstrate question-answer patterns

2. **Harmony**
   - Use chord treatment to show chord progressions
   - Common progressions (I-V-vi-IV)
   - Voice leading principles

3. **Form**
   - Record different sections (A, B)
   - Show ABA song form
   - Build complete compositions
